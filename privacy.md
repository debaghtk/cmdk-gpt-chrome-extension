Privacy Policy for AI Assistant Extension

Last updated: October 24, 2024

1. Introduction

This privacy policy explains how our AI Assistant Extension ("the Extension") handles user data. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of any information processed by our Extension.

2. Data Collection and Usage

Our Extension does not collect, store, or process any of the following types of data:

- Personally identifiable information (e.g., name, address, email, age, identification numbers)
- Health information
- Financial and payment information
- Authentication information (except as noted below regarding API keys)
- Personal communications
- Location data
- Web browsing history
- User activity data (e.g., clicks, mouse position, scroll, or keystroke logging)
- Website content

3. OpenAI API Key

The Extension requires users to input their OpenAI API key to function. This key is stored locally in the user's browser using Chrome's secure storage API. We do not have access to this key and it is only used to authenticate API requests to OpenAI.

4. User Queries

When you use the Extension, your text queries are sent to OpenAI's API to generate responses. These queries are not stored by our Extension and are only used for the immediate purpose of generating AI responses.

5. Generated Content

The AI-generated content received from OpenAI is temporarily held in the Extension's memory for the sole purpose of inserting it into your active text field. This content is immediately discarded after use and is not stored or transmitted elsewhere.

6. Data Transmission

The only data transmitted by our Extension are:
- Your OpenAI API key (sent securely to OpenAI for authentication)
- Your text queries (sent to OpenAI for processing)

All data is transmitted securely using HTTPS.

7. Third-Party Services

Our Extension uses OpenAI's API to generate text responses. Please refer to OpenAI's privacy policy for information on how they handle data: https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy

8. Data Protection

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your data.

9. User Rights

As we do not collect or store personal data, there is no personal data for users to access, modify, or delete. Users can remove the Extension at any time, which will delete any locally stored data (such as the API key).

10. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Chrome Web Store.
